# Angular 2 Heroes Tutorial

Just following along with the Angular 2 tutorial that creates the Heroes Dashboard on the Angular site.

Follow this [link](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) to find that.
I also used the QuickStart github project, to help with the setup of the project.
You can find that [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/setup.html)
